    $ java -jar match.jar <text file> <pattern file>
    (see ./examples/example.sh)

the arguments are as follows:

1. <text file>      Name of file to be searched
2. <pattern file>   Name of file containing exact characters to be matched

The program will output the index of the first exact match.
