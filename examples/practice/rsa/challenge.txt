Challenge Program:

    crypt.jar

Challenge Question:

    Does the Challenge Program contain any vulnerability that would allow
    for the secret key generated by the seed to be extracted (and thus associated
    with the seed) solely by measuring the time response of repeated queries to the
    crypt program?

Additional background for question:

    None

Available Operations:

    Passive Observations: None
    Active Interactions:  Run Challenge Program once (1)

Operational Budget:

    Max number of operations : 10001
    Probability of success   : 99%
